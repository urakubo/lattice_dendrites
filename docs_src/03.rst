All tutorial programs are located in $LD_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/tutorial. Find the following script in the subdirectory "1". It includes utility functions for tutorial 1. The function "make_cylinder" makes a cylinder with a indicated radius and length. The function "add_shape" locates such a geometric object in a volume space. The function "show_dendrite" loads and displays the surface objects of cellular boundary, postsynaptic density (PSD), mitochondrion, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
