Tutorial 1: schematic dendrite
==============================

We would introduce how to use LD and LM through two tutorials. In this tutorial (tutorial 1), we first build a dendritic spine that is represented by a schematic shape (ball and stick), then two types of simulation are conducted: Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Through these simulations, users can understand how to build a spiny dendrite, label the spine, run simulation, and visualize the simulation results.

All tutorial programs are located in $LD_DIRECTORY/tutorial. Find the following script in the subdirectory "1". It provides utility functions that are used in tutorial 1. The function "make_cylinder" makes a cylinder with an indicated radius and length. The function "add_shape" locates a geometric object into a volume space. The function "show_dendrite" loads and displays the surface objects of cellular boundary, postsynaptic density (PSD), mitochondrion, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
