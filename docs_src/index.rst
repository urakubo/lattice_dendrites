Lattice dendrites
=================

Lattice Microbes (LM) is a software package for efficiently sampling trajectories from the chemical and reaction-diffusion master equations (CME/RDME) using Graphics Processing Units (GPU).

Lattice Dendrites (LD) is an extension of LM that can incorporate morphologically realistic shapes of cells, in particular, from 3-dimentional (3D) reconstruction of electron microscopic (EM) images. LD is fully written in Python.

LD is licensed under the MIT license. The original LM is licensed under the University of Illinois Open Source License. More info on LM can be found at http://www.scs.illinois.edu/schulten/lm/.
