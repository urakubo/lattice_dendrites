Tutorial 2: realistic dendrite
==============================

We utilized a schematic shape of spiny dendrite in tutorial 1,
but can incorporate any shape.
In pariticular, LD has utility functions to incorporate
morphologically realistic shapes of cell from Reconstruct [#Fiala]_ .


LD also has importer from manual annotation from UNI-EM anntator [#Urakubo]_.

We would like to introduce how to do it.
