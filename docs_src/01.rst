Lattice Microbes (LM) is a software package for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion processes in cell biological systems [#LM1]_. LM computes chemical and reaction-diffusion master equations (CME/RDME) using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) [#LM2]_, and is recently used for the simulation of mRNA splicing in a HeLa cell [#LM3]_.

LM has been designed for building geometrically-shaped cells. However, LM essentially can incorporate any shapes of cells and cellular structure, as demonstrated in a previous study [#LM4]_.

We here developed an extension of LM, which is named Lattice Dendrites (LD), for the efficient incorporation of realistic shapes of cells and cellular structure. In particular, LD is designed to incorporate segmented volumes from the images of electron microscopy (EM). LD provides a variety of utility classes/functions for:

#. Import of the shape data formatted in a software for EM segmentation (Reconstruct).
#. Object rotation to minimize their volume in a rectangular solid.
#. Manual annotation using UNI-EM annotator. 
#. Distrubtion of surface molecules whose densites are proportional to surface area.
#. Simulation with events.
#. Data analyses for visualization.

Users can use use a variety of functions below for their model development, simulation, and analyses. Their usages are described in Tutorials 1 and 2.
In tutorial 1, we would introduce how to build a geometrically-shaped dendritic spine, and how to simulate |Ca2+| influx through  N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).
In tutorial 2, we would introduce how to import realistic shapes of cells from the external software Reconstruct, and how to annotate them using UNI-EM annotator.
