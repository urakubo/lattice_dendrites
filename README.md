# lattice_dendrites
Lattice Dendrites (LD) is an extension of lattice microbes that can incorporate morphologically realistic shapes of cells, in particular, from 3-dimentional (3D) reconstruction of electron microscopic (EM) images. LD is fully written in Python. Please read the [manual](https://urakubo.github.io/lattice_dendrites/) to learn how to use LD.
