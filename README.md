# lattice_dendrites
Lattice Dendrites (LD) is an extension of lattice microbes (LM) that can incorporate morphologically realistic shapes of cells, in particular, from volumetric images of electron microscopy (EM). LM is orignally designed for Python2, and reconfigured for Python3. For detailed information, please see the [manual](https://urakubo.github.io/lattice_dendrites/).
