# lattice_dendrites
Lattice Dendrites (LD) is an extension of lattice microbes (LM) that can incorporate morphologically realistic shapes of cells, in particular, from 3-dimentional (3D) reconstruction of electron microscopic (EM) images. LD and LM work on Python2. I will rewrite them to work on Python3. For detailed information, please see the [manual](https://urakubo.github.io/lattice_dendrites/).
