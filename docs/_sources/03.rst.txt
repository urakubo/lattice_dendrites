Tutorial 1: schematic dendrite
==============================

In this tutorial (tutorial 1), we first build a dendritic spine that is represented by a geometrical shape (ball and stick), then conduct two types of simulation: Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Through these simulations, users can understand how to build a spiny dendrite, label the spine, run simulation, and visualize the simulation results.

All tutorial programs are located in $LD_DIRECTORY/tutorial. Find the following script in the subdirectory "1". It provides utility functions that are used in tutorial 1. The function "make_cylinder" makes a cylinder in a voxel space. The function "add_shape" embed a voxel object at the location specified by the barycenter. The function "show_dendrite" displays the surface objects of cellular contours, postsynaptic densities (PSD), mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
