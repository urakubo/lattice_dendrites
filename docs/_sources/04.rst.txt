Tutorial 2: realistic dendrite
==============================

In tutorial 1, we utilized a schematic shape of spiny dendrite.
However, LD can incorporate any shape, including morphologically realistic shapes of cells.
In pariticular, LD has utility functions to incorporate 3D shapes based on volumetric EM images in the software Reconstruct [#Fiala]_ . In tutorial 2, HU would introduce such utility functions.

Morphologically realistics shapes of cellular structure also requires ...
LD also has importer from manual annotation from UNI-EM anntator [#Urakubo]_.

We would like to introduce how to do it.
