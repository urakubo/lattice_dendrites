Tutorial 2: realistic dendrite
==============================

In tutorial 1, the shape of spiny dendrite has been developed as a combination of geometric shapes. Some users may further want to incorporate a morphologically realistic shape of spiny dendrite or the other cellular structure. As expected, any voxelized data of cellular shapes can be incorporated in LM, e.g., the voxelized data obtained using the Python client CouldVolume [#Volume]_  from a Neuroglancer volume [#Glancer]_ .


However, because LM can only simulate molecules within a cuboid space, the spatial re-arrangement of the shape data may be required to decrease a dead space for efficient computation. In addition, the widely-used labeling software 'Reconstruct' stores data in a vector-style format [#Fiala]_ , thus the data conversion is required. Further, it is not easy to label parts of such a morphologically realistic shape.


In the first section of tutorial 2, We would introduce some utility functions to incorporate 3D shapes from the software Reconstruct [#Fiala]_ . Convex hull.


In the second section, we would label parts of dendrites 

Morphologically realistics shapes of cellular structure also requires ...
LD also has importer from manual annotation from UNI-EM anntator [#Urakubo]_ .
