Tutorial 2: realistic dendrite
==============================

We utilized a schematic shape of spiny dendrite in tutorial 1,
but any shape can be incorpolated through LD.
In pariticular, LD has utility functions to incorporate
morphologically realistic shapes of cell from Reconstruct [1]_ .

We would like to introduce how to do it.
