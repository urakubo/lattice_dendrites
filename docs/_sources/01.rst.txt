Overview

Lattice Microbes (LM) is a software package for efficiently sampling trajectories from the chemical and reaction-diffusion master equations (CME/RDME) using Graphics Processing Units (GPU) [#LM1]_ .
It can even utilize multiple GPUs [#LM2]_. It was recently used for the simulation of mRNA splicing in a HeLa cell[#LM3]_.

Morphologically realistics shapes of cellular structures, in particular, dendrites.

LM is orignally designed for Python2, and reconfigured for Python3.

LD is designed to work together with UNI-EM annotator.
